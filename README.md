# Naive-Bayes Algorithm
What is naive Bayes algorithm used for?
Image result for naive bayes algorithm in machine learning
Naive Bayes uses a similar method to predict the probability of different class based on various attributes. This algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes.
# Three Type of Naive Bayes:
1) MultinomialNB 2) BernoulliNB 3) GaussianNB
